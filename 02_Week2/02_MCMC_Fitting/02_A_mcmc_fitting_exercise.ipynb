    "#### We can obtain best-fit parameters using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm (MCMC). The premise here is that we have a way of representing the \"likelihood\" of a given set of parameters being the \"truth\". This is done by having a function that compares your model (given a choice of parameters) to your data, returning a \"likelihood\" that increases for more likely choices of parameters (parameters that cause a better fit to the data). Once we have this function, the MCMC algorithm essentially just tries a set number of different combinations of your model parameters in a more efficient manner than simply random choices. Based on the final distribution of samples and resulting likelihoods, we obtain estimates of the best-fit parameters and posterior distributions. \n",

    "#### Now create such a likelihood function. Remember that before we used a $\\chi^2$ function to estimate best-fit parameters. In that case, we wanted to minimize the $\\chi^2$ statistic to find best-fit parameters. Now we want a likelihood function maximize instead of minimize, but the principle is the same (calculating how well a given choice of parameters reproduces the observed data given your model). Therefore, you can just use the opposite (negative) of your $\\chi^2$ function as your likelihood function. For now, just leave your function as-is (we can add the negative in later)."

    "#### The prior function holds any information you know beforehand about the model parameters (e.g. bounds). The simplest form of prior just returns a probability of 1 if you are within specified bounds, or 0 if not. It is computationally more efficient to add numbers than multiply, and a $\\chi^2$ is already the log of a probability, so we usually use a \"log\" prior instead of simply a prior so that it can be added directly to our likelihood. Your prior function should therefore return 0 if all parameters are within their bounds ($\\ln(1)=0$), and `-np.inf` otherwise ($\\ln(0)\\rightarrow-\\infty$). You can set your bounds however you want, maybe start with (-20,20) for all parameters."
